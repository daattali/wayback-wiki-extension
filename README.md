# Wayback Wiki - Surf Wikipedia on a specific date in the past (Chrome / Firefox / Edge extension)

_Install the [Chrome extension](TODO) or [Firefox add-on](TODO)_

When surfing Wikipedia, sometimes I want to see how articles looked like on a specific date in the past. With Wayback Wiki you can choose a specific date, and every Wikipedia article you visit will automatically redirect you to the version of the article that existed on that date.

**If you enjoy my work (or just want to get special perks!), you should [support me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/daattali).**

Go to the [Chrome extension store](TODO) or [Firefox add-ons page](TODO) to instantly install with one click.
